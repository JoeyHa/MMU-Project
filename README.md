# MMU-Java Project 
Creating memory management unit to a server </br>

In computer operating systems, paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory.</br>
In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages.</br>
Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems,</br>
using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.</br>

Implements 3 Types of Page replacement algorithms: </br>

1.Random Algorithm - see Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Random </br>
2.LRU Algorithm - see Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Least_recently_used </br>
3.NRU Algorithm - see Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Not_recently_used </br>

<B>This projects use Design Patterns such as: Observer Pattern , Strategy Pattern </B> </br>
